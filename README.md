# ultrasound_trackerless_reconstruction_zoo
Implements, evaluates, and compares different ways of implementing ultrasound trajectory estimation without reliance on a tracker.

This project is also an experiment in using AI for software development and makes substantial use of AI tools. 

I am using https://github.com/QiLi111/TUS-REC2025-Challenge_baseline as an initial source of data/evaluation.
